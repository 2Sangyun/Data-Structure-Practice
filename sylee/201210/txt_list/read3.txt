i'm wandering the town all light off
i don't know where i'm leaving for
the muddy rain start to fall on me
and i'm walking down to subway
i can't see all around me
get me out of here
talk to me if someone is in this darkness
i'm out of my head
out of my mind
tell me where i'm what's going on, oh please
something is hiding me off
is this the wall of my heart
i have been lost so many things i've got
for long time i've been searching for my way
