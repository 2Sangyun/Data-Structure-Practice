crucify my love 
if my love is blind 
crucify my love 
if it sets me free 
never know never trust , that love should see a color 
crucify my love if it should be that way
swing the heartache 
feel it inside out 
when the wind cries 
i'll say good-bye 
tried to learn tried to find 
to reach out for eternity 
where’s the answer 
is this forever
