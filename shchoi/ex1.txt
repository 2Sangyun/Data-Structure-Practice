i will always remember 
the day you kissed my lips 
light as a feather 
and it went just like this 
no, it's never been better 
than the summer of 2002 
we were only eleven 
but acting like grownups 
like we are in the present 
drinking from plastic cups 
singing love is forever and ever 
well, I guess that was true
